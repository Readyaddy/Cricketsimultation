# Cricket Match Simulation Game

This is a simplified simulation of a cricket match implemented in Python. The code models ball-by-ball gameplay, tracks scores, wickets, overs, and generates commentary. The simulation involves three main classes: `CricketPlayer`, `Team`, and `Match`, along with supporting classes `Field`, `Umpire`, and `Commentator`.

## Classes Overview

### `CricketPlayer`

This class represents a cricket player with attributes such as bowling, batting, fielding, running, and experience. Players' abilities are represented as decimal values between 0 and 1.

### `Team`

The `Team` class represents a cricket team, including players, batting and bowling orders, scores, wickets, overs, and other attributes. It provides methods to manage players, set orders, and update scores.

### `Field`

The `Field` class describes field conditions like size, fan ratio, pitch conditions, and home advantage, which influence the gameplay and probabilities.

### `Umpire`

The `Umpire` class simulates the umpire's role in the game. It predicts ball outcomes based on players' abilities, field conditions, and other factors. The class calculates probabilities of getting out and generating scores.

### `Commentator`

This class generates commentary for the match based on match stats. It provides comments on over beginnings, balls bowled, batsman on strike, score updates, etc.

### `Match`

The `Match` class orchestrates the simulation. It manages the flow of the match, switching teams, and simulating innings, overs, and ball-by-ball gameplay.

## Probability Calculation

### `Umpire` Class - `predict_outcome` Method

The `predict_outcome` method calculates the probability of a batsman getting out on a given ball. It considers the batsman's and bowler's abilities, field conditions, and home advantage to determine the outcome.

### `Umpire` Class - `get_score` Method

The `get_score` method calculates the runs scored on a ball. It uses a probabilistic model with the batsman's batting ability, experience, and the bowler's bowling ability to generate scores.

#### Probability Distribution

In the `Umpire` class, the `get_score` method calculates the runs scored on a ball using a probabilistic distribution. This distribution models the likelihood of each possible score (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) based on the batsman's batting ability, experience, and the bowler's bowling ability.

The probabilities for each score are calculated using a normal distribution model, with the mean set to 1 (indicating the most likely score). The standard deviation of the distribution is determined by the batsman's batting ability and experience, adjusted by the bowler's bowling ability. This model creates a realistic representation of how different factors contribute to scoring patterns in cricket.

## Usage

The code demonstrates a basic cricket match simulation and provides a framework for more advanced simulations. You can modify the player attributes, field conditions, and other parameters to experiment with different scenarios.

## Running the Simulation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `cricket_simulation.py` file.
4. Run the command: `python cricket_simulation.py`.

## Conclusion

This cricket match simulation showcases a simplified version of a cricket match, covering key aspects such as player abilities, field conditions, probabilities, and commentary generation. It's a basic framework that can be extended for more complex simulations or games.
